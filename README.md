## 📚 Usage

ChainSheets offers a unique ecosystem where research and academic publishing are reimagined through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), each focusing on a specific research topic. Users can propose their research articles or papers to these DAOs, akin to submitting to specialized journals. 

### Roles within the DAO
- **Members**: Individuals with recognized expertise (verified through Polygon ID credentials from reputable organizations/research institutions) in the DAO's research field. They hold a threshold amount of $ExpertSHEETS and are responsible for reviewing and approving research proposals.
- **Published Papers**: Papers that have been reviewed and accepted by the DAO members.
- **Paper Holders**: Users who mint NFTs of a DAO's papers, granting them access to read these published works.

**NOTE**: The term "$ExpertSHEETS" serves as a generic placeholder. Each DAO within ChainSheets has its own distinct token name, reflecting its specific research focus and community. And these tokens are Soulbound tokens

### Token Dynamics
- **$ExpertSHEETS**: These are topic-specific tokens, unique to each DAO (e.g., $AI SHEETS for an AI-focused DAO and $BC SHEETS for a Blockchain focused DAO). Members of a DAO hold these tokens, symbolizing their expertise and role within that specific research field. Importantly, $ExpertSHEETS are **NON-TRANSFERABLE**, ensuring dedicated membership and expertise within each DAO.
- **$SHEETS**: General tokens on the ChainSheets platform, accessible to all users. They are used to mint NFTs, which grant access to published papers.


### Interactions and Rewards
- **Accessing Papers**: Users spend $SHEETS to mint NFTs, gaining access to specific published paper of a DAO the user wants. This action increases the DAO's value, indirectly benefiting its members.
- **Member Privileges**: Members with $ExpertSHEETS can access all papers published within their specific DAO.
- **Proposal Acceptance and Rewards**: When a user's research proposal is accepted by a DAO, they are rewarded with the corresponding DAO's $ExpertSHEETS. Accumulating these tokens over time can elevate a user to a DAO member, enabling them to share in the profits generated from NFT mints.

This structure fosters a self-sustaining cycle of quality research submissions, peer review, and rewarding contributions to the field, all within the ChainSheets platform.
